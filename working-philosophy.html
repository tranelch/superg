              <p>
                For every process we put natural objects through, we must make up for the loss of aliveness by replacing it with our own. When a tree is cut and shaped, changing its former integrity, the inspired vision of the Shaper infuses the wood with his or her own Spirit. The finished piece, though changed, remains a living thing and has a Life force.

              <h3>Tao te Ching, Chapter 40</h3>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Return is the movement of the Tao.
                  Yielding is the way of the Tao.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All things are born of being.
                  Being is born of non-being.
                </p>
                <p>
                  -Lao Tzu
                </p>

              <p>
                Modern day mass-produced items are, for the most part, dead. They have often been taken from the earth in an ungrateful way. They are then handled by humans who are also suffering from this disrespect and feel the lack it causes in their lives. Money is charged to replace the worth that has been stolen. We may become involved in the process as we trade money for a pretty and useful but dead thing. From us, it will ask for Life. If we value it and use it fully for its purpose, giving thanks, then we are giving it back the consciousness it was lacking.
